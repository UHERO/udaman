<h1>Duplicate series <%= @series.name %> (<%= @series.universe %>)</h1>

<p>You are attempting to duplicate a series within the same universe. All this really means is that a new series will
be created, necessarily with a different name, and most of the metadata of the original series copied in. The first
attempt may fail if the original series has any required metadata missing. Check the box if you would like all active
loaders to be copied along with the metadata. On success, you will be sent to the edit screen for the newly created
series, to make any necessary modifications.</p>

<%= form_with url: { action: :save_duplicate, id: @series } do |f| %>
  New name <%= text_field_tag :new_name, nil, size: 30 %>
    <% unless @series.enabled_data_sources.empty? %>
      <p><%= check_box_tag :copy_loaders, 'yes' %> Copy loaders along with series metadata</p>
    <% end %>
  <p>
    <%= f.submit 'Duplicate' %>
    <%= link_to 'Cancel', :back %>
  </p>
<% end %>
