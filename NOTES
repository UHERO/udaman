UA-953a:
Stuff is stashed - get it out!

After migrating data into seriesx and other tables, remove default values from nonnull columns
Deploy:
    Change primary keys on [public_]data_points tables to include xseries_id when deleting series_id
    Drop column series_id from data_points
    Drop columns with _ob
    Truncate xseries table and repopulate from series, also for data_points (or wait to do main mig until deploy time?)

Review task :create_coh_cpi_measurements to see how things need to be rearranged

Later: move demetra/factors columns to a separate table? should it be a Model? probly.
