# Note to self, the following are standard REST actions, and are
# generally handled automatically. The routes in this file are custom
# and must be defined explicitly. As of 3/18/25, I'm converting the
# old and very open wildcard handler and to explicit routes. TEDIOUS
#    index (GET)
#    show (GET)
#    new (GET)
#    create (POST)
#    edit (GET)
#    update (PATCH/PUT)
#    destroy (DELETE)
#
# I have added a route for every controller method, but note that not every method necessarily
# gets called from the UI, methods called from within the controller or another controller
# should not need a route here, but that's a task for another time.

# Routes are organized in 2 groups
#  1. Single routes
#  2. controllers with custom routes
#  3. remaining controllers alphabetically
