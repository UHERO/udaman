# Workers/Jobs

Not sure on the architecture of this yet, but ideas for regular jobs, in addition to existing udaman jobs

- Consensus: fetch articles from html and rss feeds
- Additional metrics: idk any amusing metrics we think we could get from around the island (movie ticket prices, my ben & jerries index, etc)
- QPub Scrape + Other county related websites
- MLS HOA Scrapes? What we have vs what we need
- DaBus scrape, see Sakura's scrape. (not sure if job queue can handle 1000 assignments per second)
