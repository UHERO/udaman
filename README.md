# UDAMAN 2.0

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# ToDo Notes For Later
1. Implement a standard, response shape from controllers. Something like:
    ```js
    return { message: "Succesfully did action", data: payload }
    ```
    Doesn't need to be fancy, but controller seems like the appropriate layer to handle basic logging & messages. Messages can be used in Toasts in the UI to show confirmations/errors to the user.
2. Set consistent log levels, maybe info for controllers, debug for models & collections.
